# Open Questions & Future Considerations

## Unresolved Decisions

1. **Auto-updates**: Add Sparkle framework in Phase 3, or keep manual updates?
2. **Plugin System**: Allow third-party text processors?
3. **iOS Version**: Port to iOS in the future? (would require significant redesign)
4. **Windows/Linux**: Port to other platforms? (would require Tauri/Electron rewrite)

## Feature Requests (Community-Driven)

- Voice command system for controlling Mac
- Integration with other IDEs (JetBrains, Sublime)
- Transcription history and search
- Audio file batch transcription
- Team/shared dictionary sync (privacy-preserving)
