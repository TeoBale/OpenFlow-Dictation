OpenFlow Dictation represents a unique opportunity to create a truly open, privacy-first voice dictation tool that rivals commercial offerings. By leveraging modern Apple Silicon capabilities and local AI models, we can deliver a product that is:

- **Faster** than cloud-based alternatives
- **More private** than any competitor
- **More open** than any alternative
- **Better for developers** than any dictation tool on the market

The phased approach allows for iterative development with regular user feedback, while the open source model ensures long-term sustainability and community ownership.
